            An enduring symbol of innovation, Canada's National Tower inspires and connects Canadians. The CN Tower stands tall, elevates every occasion, and celebrates infinite possibilities as it welcomes visitors from around the world.

Standing at a jaw-dropping height of 553.3 metres/1,815.5 feet, visitors to the Tower can enjoy its breathtaking views of the city and many exciting offerings. The CN Tower’s world-famous Glass Floors and EdgeWalk, the world’s highest most extreme urban adventure, are a delight to even the biggest of thrill seekers, while its award-winning restaurant is unlike any other. The elevated dining experience at 360 Restaurant celebrates Canadian cuisine and a wine selection from the world’s highest wine cellar, as designated by Guinness World Records.

As its proud owner and manager, Canada Lands continually finds ways to innovate the CN Tower’s timeless experience. Alongside its shareholder, the company announced a $21-million investment into the tourist attraction to modernize its outdoor terrace level. Learn more about the multi-million-dollar project.
